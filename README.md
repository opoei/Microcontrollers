ECE 473 assignments.  
AVR-GCC v4.8.1

From the course webpage
 > The purpose of this course is to equip students to competently design small, embedded microcontroller systems. This course uses a microcontroller as a component in electronic system design. Our target microcontroller, the Atmel ATMega128, provides extensive I/O and peripherals. It will be considered as a flexible logic component to be embedded into a system.

> This is a design course. This means that you will be expected to show considerable creativity, resourcefulness and persistence. You will need to read long datasheets, improvise around problems, and extract information from obscure sources. You will need to apply material from many of the courses you have already taken. You will have to find solutions on your own from incomplete specifications. Welcome to the real world of design.
